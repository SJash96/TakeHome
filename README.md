# TakeHome

This project consists of the Spring backend and React frontend.

In Spring, you can start locally and explore some endpoints which are listed in the spring folder which will bring forth all data or centroid based data.

React shows a more visualization via google maps of all the data and it's polygons mapped out as well as the centroid data within the lat, long points give.
Instructions for those will be found in the react folder as well.
